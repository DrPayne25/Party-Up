## Connor 
### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
I’ll be good at project planning through the process, possibly being a good resource when it comes to updating the project board.

My work usually does a daily standup that allows people to bring forth their ideas and work related items to the table. In that same structure prior to actually doing any work, having a standup can help with getting everyone aligned on the tasks that are needed to get done for the day. 


## Michael

I want to have really good documentation to work on my organizational skills in preparation for the project.
### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
We should divide our work into segments of functionality that have easily identifiable connection points. This would enable simultaneous development.

## Conflict Plan
### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
No need to yell when trying to get your point across. Take the time to hear both sides and see if you can get to a mutual agreement. Try a group vote method if needed. If nothing else works, then pull in a Roger. We hope to bring any conflicts to the front and discuss the issues and see if we can try and bring both sides 
### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
If you are feeling an issue, bring it up with the team. We hope to bring everyone along with us for this awesome ride.
### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We hope to try and get that person as caught up as we can but also not implement any code that everyone doesn’t understand. 
### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Don’t address the issue directly first discuss with another team member's opinion on what they think and if that doesn’t work then we bring it up as a team. 
### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
Escalate when we can’t come to an agreement as a team.

## Software Requirements
### Vision
### What is the vision of this product?
This web application is a place for gamers to be able to meet each other virtually, think of it like Linkedin but with gaming.

Additional features will be added like direct messaging

### What pain point does this project solve?
This solves the pain point of loneliness of not having anyone to play games with. Everyone has a game they really like and are good at, why not have a community you can showcase your skills to? Well Party Up is a web application that allows users to keep up to date with each other and find a diverse amount of users that may play similar games. This sandbox idea gives the user the power to request help for gaming’s hardest boss battles and/or levels. Don’t game alone, Party Up®

A users will be able to look through a list of games and be able to add them games they want to a wishlist   
A user will be able to message others users from any page within the app   

## Data Flow
Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.

In our data flow we want the user to initate contact through the login page where they can login or create an account. From there once the user has been able to successfully login ino their account they should be able to view a landing page that will have the user's feed and profile path veiwable on the page. In this instacne we would like there to API calls that would utilize things like Xbox, Steam, Playstation when interacting with games that are of interest to the user. From the user's profile they can venture into looking into the wishlist, direct messaging menu, comment board, game reviews, accolades or discord API. This allows the user to use these paths to do multiple different features.

**Direct Messaging** 
- Shows users that the indiviual has followed/friended. Can make short messaegs between one user to the next.
**WishList**
- User may add and remove from wishlist allowing for any game the user is looking to purchase or play in the near future.
**Comment Board**
- The player may be able to leave comments to other users and in turn leave comments to other users about games, strtegies, etc.
**Game Reviews**
- Allows users to give reviews to their favorite games and reccomend certain games they like best of different genres.
**Accolades**
- A cool aesthetic, users can endorse other users on how well they are play particular games and what skills they have in multiple games if need be.
**Discord API**
- Give the user tha ability to for PArties with their new user friends and take it to discord for live voice channels. 

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Testability - We will be writing unit tests for each method we use on our app along with unit tests to test out functionality of the app. We hope to write at least 2 tests for each method or function. Along with achieving 80% testing coverage using pytest as our testing option.  
2. Security - We are hoping to use AuthO to allow users to create accounts and handle all of the authentication for us.
