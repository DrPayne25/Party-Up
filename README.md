Hoping to get better at my technical skills for this part of the course think that will help me improving my coding skills
### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

## Connor 
### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
I’ll be good at project planning through the process, possibly being a good resource when it comes to updating the project board.
I do well with coding along with others with mob coding, it helps to be either the driver or the observer. Can deliver good feedback or suggestions to functions that are being coded out.

My work usually does a daily standup that allows people to bring forth their ideas and work related items to the table. In that same structure prior to actually doing any work, having a standup can help with getting everyone aligned on the tasks that are needed to get done for the day. 


## Michael
### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Public speaking.
Rapid research.

I want to have really good documentation to work on my organizational skills in preparation for the project.
### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
We should divide our work into segments of functionality that have easily identifiable connection points. This would enable simultaneous development.

## Conflict Plan
### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
No need to yell when trying to get your point across. Take the time to hear both sides and see if you can get to a mutual agreement. Try a group vote method if needed. If nothing else works, then pull in a Roger. We hope to bring any conflicts to the front and discuss the issues and see if we can try and bring both sides 
### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
If you are feeling an issue, bring it up with the team. We hope to bring everyone along with us for this awesome ride.
### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We hope to try and get that person as caught up as we can but also not implement any code that everyone doesn’t understand. 
### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Don’t address the issue directly first discuss with another team member's opinion on what they think and if that doesn’t work then we bring it up as a team. 
### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
Escalate when we can’t come to an agreement as a team.

## Software Requirements
### Vision
### What is the vision of this product?
This web application is a place for gamers to be able to meet each other virtually, think of it like Linkedin but with gaming. Users can post about games they are playing and make unique profiles that show what games they're playing, what they’re looking for in a party, and endorsements on how their game play is. Additional features will be added like direct messaging

### What pain point does this project solve?
This solves the pain point of loneliness of not having anyone to play games with. Everyone has a game they really like and are good at, why not have a community you can showcase your skills to? Well Party Up is a web application that allows users to keep up to date with each other and find a diverse amount of users that may play similar games. This sandbox idea gives the user the power to request help for gaming’s hardest boss battles and/or levels. Don’t game alone, Party Up®
